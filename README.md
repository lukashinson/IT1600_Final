<p> This tutorial will teach on how to convert decimals to binary numbers and vice versa. My goal for this tutorial is for it be easy to understand and easy to use. </p>
<p> The target audience for this tutorial will be anyone needing to convert decimal to binary or binary to decimal! </p>
<br>
<h2> Now time for the tutorial </h2>
<ol>
  <li>Write down the decimal number.</li>
  <li>Divide the number by 2.</li>
  <li>Write the result underneath.</li>
  <li>Write the remainder on the right side. (This will be 1 or 0) </li>
  <li>Continue dividing and writing down remainders until the result of the division is 0.</li>
  <li>Read the numbers from bottom up. That will be the binary equivalent to the decimal number. </li>
</ol>

<h2> An example worked out! </h2>
